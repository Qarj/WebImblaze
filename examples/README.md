# WebImblaze Examples

## Running examples

1. Open the Command Prompt

2. Ensure the current directory is where wi.pl resides e.g. `cd C:\git\webimblaze` if that is where you put it

3. Call wi.pl specifying the relative path of the example to run

**Example**
```
perl wi.pl examples/post.test
perl wi.pl examples/advanced/include.test
```

Note that in this example, a configuration file was not specified.
WebImblaze will by default use config.xml in the same folder wi.pl is located.
