# WebInject Examples

## Running examples

1. Open the Command Prompt as an Administrator

2. Ensure the current directory is where webinject.pl resides e.g. `cd C:\git\webinject` if that is where you put it

3. Call webinject.pl specifying the relative path of the example to run

**Example:**
```
C:\git\WebInject>webinject.pl examples\post.xml
```

Note that in this example, a configuration file was not specified. WebInject will by default use config.xml in the same folder as where webinject.pl is located.
