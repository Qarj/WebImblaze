    With a post request, it is typical to first get a web page with something on it (for example, a form) first.

    In this example, we get a a dummy form on a website especially created for WebInject examples.

    Then we post to the website. The website responds with a simple confirmation page. 

    Note that in this example, the website URL is defined with a local test variable.
