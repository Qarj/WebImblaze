    It is possible to run an operating system command, or any program using a shell parameter.

    This is done through the perl backtick method.

    If the shell command you run writes to the console, WebImblaze will capture it. This means you can run assertions against it.

    Potential uses in automated tests:
        * ftping files
        * checking the system application error log
        * parsing folders containing emails to send (in test environments, emails are not normally sent, but rather are available in a Pickup folder

step:                   Get the directory listing of the current folder
shell:                  dir
