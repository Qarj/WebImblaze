    The {TOTALJOBS} substitution is defined in config.xml in the same folder webinject.pl is located

    http:// is not included as part of the substitution in this example. This is because the website
    also uses https://

    It would be awkward to two substitutions, with a second one called {TOTALJOBSHTTPS} (for example)
    containing much the same information.

    Defining substitutions of {HTTP} and {HTTPS} would be just silly.
