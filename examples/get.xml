<!--
The {TOTALJOBS} substitution is defined in config.xml in the same folder webinject.pl is located

http:// is not included as part of the substitution in this example. This is because the website
also uses https://

It would be awkward to two substitutions, with a second one called {TOTALJOBSHTTPS} (for example)
containing much the same information.

Defining substitutions of {HTTP} and {HTTPS} would be just silly.
