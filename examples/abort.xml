<!--
When the abort="true" parameter is present on a test step, then execution will be halted if
any verification on that test step has failed (after all retries have been exhausted).

The idea is that it allows you to stop test execution if there is a serious problem.

For example, if the login page is failing to load, then there is no point proceeding with a
complicated workflow.
