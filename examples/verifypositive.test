    So long as your verifypostive starts with verifypositive, you can have as many as you want.
    You can use numbers or letters to make distinct verifications.

    The verifypositiveHTML example shows the use of regular expressions for the verification.
    In this example, . matches any single character.

    The other important point to note is the verification is against the raw response.
    This means when you get an html page as a response, the verification is against the html
    and not the rendered version of the html you would see in a browser.
