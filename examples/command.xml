<!--
When you set the method to command, then it is possible to run an operating system command, or any program.

This is done through the perl backtick method.

If the command you run writes to the console, WebInject will capture it. This means you can run assertions against it.

Potential uses in automated tests:
* ftping files
* checking the system application error log
* parsing folders containing emails to send (in test environments, emails are not normally sent, but rather are available in a Pickup folder
