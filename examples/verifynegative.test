    So long as your verifynegative starts with verifynegative, you can have as many as you want.
    You can use numbers or letters to make distinct verifications.

    verifynegative is typically used for asserting that things that should not be there, are not.

    Bugs are a good candidate for the use of verifynegative. When a bug appears, put in a verifynegative
    that highlights the existence of a bug. When the bug is fixed, the check will start passing again.

    Bugs that have appeared before a likely to appear again!

    verifynegative is also great for detecting the existence of environmental issues.

    The other important point to note is the verification is against the raw response.
    This means when you get an html page as a response, the verification is against the html
    and not the rendered version of the html you would see in a browser.
