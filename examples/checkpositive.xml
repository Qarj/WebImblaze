<!--
In this example checkpositive in step 20 says to look at the most recent result of verifypositive2. If
it failed, then this test step, step 20, will be automatically failed without being run.

The point of this is to stop a long running test step from running if we know from a previous
test step failure that it has no chance of working. Sometimes timeouts can be very long.
This gives us a way of failing fast.

Note that due to a minor bug, the execution time of the automatically failed test step will
be shown as the same as the previous test step.
