    When restartbrowseronfail is present, the WebImblaze session
    and Selenium WebDriver (if applicable) browser will be restarted
    before excuting the next test step - *if* this test step failed.

    In the event that there is a retry on the same test step, then the restart
    will occur before retrying.

    A message is displayed indicating the parameter was invoked.

    The restart will have the effect of dumping all cookies.
