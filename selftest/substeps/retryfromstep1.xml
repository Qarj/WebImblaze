<!--
Self test sub step file. Some test steps may fail. 
Expected failures will be asserted by the master test file.

<!--

Here we mix retryfromstep and retry in the same file.

Note that retryfromstep and retry have their own sub numbering systems
so it is possible to tell the two apart and give every attempt a unique
number.
