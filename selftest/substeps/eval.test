evalEXPECT_FALSE:       5>7
evalEXPECT_TEN:         4 + 6
evalEXPECT_TRUE:        7>5

step:                   Check eval true, false results: _{EXPECT_TRUE}_, _{EXPECT_FALSE}_
echo:                   Should be true _{EXPECT_TRUE}_ | Should be false _{EXPECT_FALSE}_
verifypositive1:        Should be true _1_

step:                   Check eval maths: _{EXPECT_TEN}_, _{EXPECT_24}_
echo:                   Should be 10 _{EXPECT_TEN}_ | Should be 24 _{EXPECT_24}_
verifypositive1:        Should be 10 _10_
verifypositive2:        Should be 24 _24_

step:                   Perform evals with other variables
section:                Set vars
varNINETY:              90
varTEN:                 10

step:                   Perform evals with other variables
evalEXPECT_HUNDRED:     {NINETY}+{TEN}

step:                   Check hundred: _{EXPECT_HUNDRED}_
echo:                   Should be hundred _{EXPECT_HUNDRED}_
verifypositive1:        Should be hundred _100_

step:                   Perform evals with octal number - leading 0
section:                Octal
evalEXPECT_EIGHT:       010

step:                   Check leading zero treated as Octal
echo:                   Should be eight _{EXPECT_EIGHT}_
verifypositive1:        Should be eight _8_
