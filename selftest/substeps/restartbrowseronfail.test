step:                   Get login page sets .AspNetCore.Antiforgery cookie
url:                    http://{WIC}/Search/SearchForm
verifypositive:         Set-Cookie: .AspNetCore.Antiforgery

step:                   Get login page again does not set the same cookie again - it is already set
desc:           Step will fail
url:                    http://{WIC}/Search/SearchForm
verifypositive:         Set-Cookie: .AspNetCore.Antiforgery

step:                   Browser is restarted due to an error
shell:                  echo NOP
verifypositive:         Some text that is not there
restartbrowseronfail:   true

step:                   Get login page sets .AspNetCore.Antiforgery cookie since all cookies are gone
url:                    http://{WIC}/Search/SearchForm
verifypositive:         Set-Cookie: .AspNetCore.Antiforgery

step:                   Browser is not restarted since the test step passes
shell:                  echo Some text that is there
verifypositive:         Some text that is there
restartbrowseronfail:   true

step:                   Get login page already has .AspNetCore.Antiforgery cookie
desc:           Step will fail
url:                    http://{WIC}/Search/SearchForm
verifypositive:         Set-Cookie: .AspNetCore.Antiforgery
