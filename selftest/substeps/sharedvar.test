step:                   Write a shared var
varKEY:                 {RANDOM:5}
shell:                  echo NOP
writesharedvar:         MY_SPECIAL_VAR|my secret {KEY}

step:                   Read a shared var - value is [{MY_SPECIAL_VAR}]
shell:                  echo [{MY_SPECIAL_VAR}]
verifypositive:         my secret {KEY}
readsharedvar:          MY_SPECIAL_VAR

step:                   Read a non existing shared variable, value of [{DOES_NOT_EXIST}]
shell:                  echo value of [{DOES_NOT_EXIST}]
verifypositive:         value of \[]
readsharedvar:          DOES_NOT_EXIST

step:                   Overwrite shared var with null
shell:                  echo NOP
writesharedvar:         MY_SPECIAL_VAR|

step:                   Read a shared var - value is [{MY_SPECIAL_VAR}]
shell:                  echo value of [{MY_SPECIAL_VAR}]
verifypositive:         value of \[]
readsharedvar:          MY_SPECIAL_VAR

# On first execution {WILL_NOT_BE_FOUND} will not be substituted since it hasn't been read yet
step:                   Read a shared var - value is [{WILL_NOT_BE_FOUND}]
shell:                  REM value of [{WILL_NOT_BE_FOUND}]
readsharedvar:          WILL_NOT_BE_FOUND
verifypositive:         This step will not run, so it will not fail
runif:                  {WILL_NOT_BE_FOUND}
retry:                  2
