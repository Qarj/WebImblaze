Let's say you are testing that your website detects a file uploaded to it with
a test virus. Unfortunately your desktop probably has a virus scanner on it
that cannot be disabled.

However you may agree with Corporate IT that a certain directory on one of your 
servers - the automation controller - can have a folder with an exclusion on
it for virus checking.

This feature allows you to skip running a test case on your desktop that is
doomed to failure, but allow it to run from your test controller server.
