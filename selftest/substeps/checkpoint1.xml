<!--
Self test sub step file. Some test steps may fail. 
Expected failures will be asserted by the master test file.

<!--

Here we mix checkpoint, retryfromstep and retry in the same file.

Note that checkpoint/retryfromstep and retry have their own sub numbering systems
so it is possible to tell the two apart and give every attempt a unique
number.
