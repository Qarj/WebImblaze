step:                   Should not jump back since the assertions pass

verifynegative:         two

step:                   Should not jump back since a fail fast flag is present

step:                   Step 40

step:                   Should not sleep since checkpoint is not triggered

step:                   Will pass on attempt two

step:                   Should jump back 8 times due to verifypositive failure
desc:                   jumpbacks variable will update between jumpbacks:{JUMPBACKS}, and also mynum variable {MYNUM} will be

step:                   Info - mynum variable at this point is {MYNUM}

step:                   Should not jump back - globaljumpbacks limit defined in checkpointconfig.xml file reached
