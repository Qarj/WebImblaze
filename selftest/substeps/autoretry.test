step:                   Should not retry since autoretry is not enabled in config or yet in script
shell:                  echo ten
verifypositive:         text not present

step:                   Should retry twice since retry parameter wins
shell:                  echo twenty
verifypositive:         text not present
autoretry:              5
retry:                  2

step:                   Will retry once only - there have been 4 attempts since last success
shell:                  echo thirty
verifypositive:         text not present

step:                   Will not retry since autoretry is now disabled after being exhausted
shell:                  echo forty
verifypositive:         text not present

step:                   Passing step
shell:                  echo fifty

step:                   Will retry 5 times due to autoretry being re-enabled by the passing step
shell:                  echo sixty
verifypositive:         text not present

step:                   Passing step
shell:                  echo seventy

step:                   Will not retry due to presence of ignoreautoretry parameter
shell:                  echo eighty
verifypositive:         text not present
autoretry:              10
ignoreautoretry:        true

step:                   Will not retry due to autoretry effectively being turned off by setting to 0
shell:                  echo ninety
verifypositive:         text not present
autoretry:              0
